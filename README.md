# Building blocks of a web application

1. **User Interface** - how users will consume and interact with your application

2. **Routing** - how users navigate between different parts of your application

3. **Data Fetching** - where your data lives and how to get it

4. **Rendering** - when and wehre you render static or dynamic content.

5. **Integrations** - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.

6. **Infrastructure** - where you deploy, store, and run your application code(Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).

7. **Performance** - how to optimize your application for end-users.

8. **Scalability** - how your application adapts as your team, data and traffic grow.

9. **Developer Experience** - your team's experience building and maintaining your application.

For each part of your application, you will need to decide whether you will build a solution yourself or use other tools such as libraries and frameworks.

Part of React's success is that it is relatively unopinionated about the other aspects of building applications. This has resulted in a flourishing ecosystem of 3rd party tools and solutions.

As a result, developers need to spend time configuring tools and reinventing solutions for common application requirements.

Next.js is a React framework that handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

# Different stages

1. The environment where your code runs: Development vs Production

2. When your code runs: Build Time vs Runtime

3. Where rendering happens: Client vs Server

# Setup

> package.json
> {

}

npm install react react-dom next
# next
